title: HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
---

The relatively new HTTP / 2 protocol significantly speeds page loading and is widely supported by all major browsers and servers.

## Disadvantages of HTTP/1.1

Previously, HTTP/1.1 was the major version of HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web, implemented across clients and servers.

That worked well for few years. But as modern day applications and websites evolved and the amount of data to be loaded on a single page increased, the drawbacks of HTTP/1.1 became more prominent.

### One Open Request Per Connection

HTTP/1.1 practically allows only one outstanding request per TCP connection (though HTTP pipelining allows more than one outstanding request, it still doesn’t solve the problem completely).

### Duplication Of Data

The other problem with HTTP/1.1 is the duplication of data across requests (cookies and other headers). Too many requests means too much redundant data, which would impact performance.

This led to the development of techniques like image sprites (combining multiple image requests into a single one) and domain-sharding (splitting the requests for resources over multiple domains to increase the number of possible parallel TCP connections).

## Advantages Of HTTP/2

HTTP/2 was built over Google’s SPDY protocol with the above shortcomings of HTTP/1.1 kept in mind. The main advantages of HTTP/2 over HTTP/1.1 as pulled from their Github page are -

### Multiplexed, instead of ordered

Allows using same TCP connection for multiple parallel requests

### Header compression using HPACK

Compressed headers, reduced data redundancy

### Server Push

Instead of waiting for the client to request for assets like JS and CSS, the server can “push” the resources it believes would be required by the client. Avoids the round trip.

### HTTP/2 In Action
